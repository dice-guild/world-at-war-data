China of the period was incredibly poor and quality of equipment was miserable for half of the NRA, with many men having close to no live firearms practice, barely getting enough to eat, and not even being supplied with boots. Considering some reports of brutal mass conscription, a lack of political motivation for non-nationalist/communist troops, and limited financial support, it's no surprise many men had rock bottom motivation.",

Despite this, the NRA regular was described as 'fit', 'hardy', 'obedient', and 'asking little in return'.

He often wasn't a volunteer, nor was he motivated by the nationalist or communist parties. However, unlike a large number of the people of his country, he could read. While maybe half or less of the soldiers of the NRA had a good uniform, boots, and a rifle; the average soldier in service to Yan Xishan could've had spares. Every single one of these men was born in their province and some of them had lived their whole lives with Yan Xishan in power, hearing people repeat his speeches, and reading his newspapers. They spent the time they didn't spend training, building roads, and helping farmers, which made them very popular with many ordinary people. While it's not clear how well the average soldier of Yan Xishan understood the man's seemingly complex blend of every single modern European and ancient Chinese philosophy, the warlord claimed to practice a philosophy of service, modernity, and equality. At the very least, the average soldier would notice the 'land reforms' and how many of the corrupt elite seemed to despise Yan Xishan.",

Even Mao wasn't sure if he wanted to refer to Yan Xishan's thinking as 'suicidal tactics' or praise him for waging complete resistance with no surrender. Yan Xishan's best men were at times better equipped than the Japanese, and were heavily motivated by: better treatment, better living conditions, Yan Xishan's appearance of being a complex and intelligent philosophical leader, seemingly endless automatic weapons, and the fact that Yan Xishan would personally order the execution of commanders he thought were cowardly. According to some reports, for every one of them that died, they took as many as two, three, four, or even five Japanese.",

'Yen was equipping his troops with a locally produced copy of the Thompson sub machine gun, chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, but was experiencing supply difficulties as his troops' sidearms were 7.63mm caliber C96 handguns. Yan's solution was to produce a .45 ACP caliber version of the C96, thus standardizing ammunition and making supply logistics easier. Designated Type 17, production of the .45 caliber handgun began in 1929 at the Taiyuan Arsenal and ended in 1931. They are inscribed (in Chinese) '17' on the left hand side of the gun, and 'Republic Year Eighteen, Made in Shansi' on the right hand side. They were issued (along with Thompson SMGs) to railway guards in the province as defense against bandits and other warlords.",
